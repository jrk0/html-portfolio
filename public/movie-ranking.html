<h1>The Definitive Movie List</h1>

<h2>3 of my favorite movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>The Dude abides.  An amazingly funny mystery by the Coen Brothers that spins the classic Raymond Chandler tale.</p>

<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Gotta agree with Angela on this one.  A stylish thriller that drips with neon ambiance.  Ryan Gosling gives an amazing performance.</p>

<h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
<p>A sequel to the classic scifi film that put cyberpunk on the map.  Ryan Gosling kills it again.</p>
